# The Single Founder Handbook

A step-by-step handbook for bootstrappers by Mike Taber.

# Starting a Business

Please answer:

1. What 3x things do you expect owning your own business will do for you?
2. Why do you want each of those 3x things.

Taber's answers were:

1. For a flexible schedule
2. To be financially independent
3. To solve challenging problems

Use your answers to understand what motivates you and to focus on what type of business you'll
start.

# Founders and Co-founders

Having a bad co-founder is much worse than having no co-founder at all.

The best reason to start a business alone is to be "Master of Your Own Destiny". It's to be in
control of everything.

# Fears We Have

* don't be afraid to pursue a product that's already been done
* don't be afraid of people copying your idea
* even if a product already exists, you can do something slightly different or fix something that
  customers hate
* competition means your idea has been validated
* don't be afraid of failing: run experiments, measure, learn, and repeat
* don't be afraid of the unknown: keep track of data to overcome biases
* don't be afraid of risks: better to fail now than stick to a life you'll hate for 20 years

# Developer to Entrepreneur

Product development won't make or break your business. Marketing is more important. It's hard for
developers to accept, but benefits matter more than features. Marketing matters more than what
technology your product is built on.

Developers also tend to undervalue their work. Charge more! Charge based on value, how much money
or time are you saving your customers?

# Motivation and Decision Fatigue

Wealthy people tend to:

* make to-do lists
* wake up earlier
* listen to audiobooks
* read
* exercise
* watch less TV
* write down and focus on goals
* believe good habits are responsible for success
* believe bad habits are detrimental to success

Try to do the same. Create habits to work on your business instead of watching TV. Habits means
making less decisions, which means less depletion on your willpower and more motivation. Make a
schedule and stick to it!

# The Power of Focus

Some suggestions:

* Set an unbreakable deadline
* Use Parkinson's Law so you only work on the essential
* Use the Pomodoro Technique
* Use David Allen's GTD method
* Use "Don't Break the Chain" (Jerry Seinfeld method for habits)

# Time Management and Planning

It's a good idea to write down your high level goals, like achieving $10k/mo income. But it's
important to also have a daily to-do list.

Taber also recommends the SMART method: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, time bound.

# Time Tracking

You don't know how much time you're wasting until you measure it. Use a time tracking tool.

There are two types:

* manual entry - good to know how much time is spent on each project
* automatic tracking - good to know how much time is spent per application

Manual is useful for freelancers and contractors, so you'll know how much to bill per client or
project. Automatic is useful for analyzing your productivity, so you'll know how much time you spend
playing games vs your text editor.

# Building Systems

Systems help grow your business. Having systems in place helps you automate via software or
outsourcing. Or you can even eliminate it completely.

To start, think of a common task you repeatedly do for your business. Write down the steps to
complete this task. This piece of documentation is usually called "Standard Operating Procedures".
Writing it down ensures that everyone else will follow the same process, including yourself.

Once you have the document, you can start following it yourself. Taking the strategic level thinking
out of the equation helps par down decision fatigue. You can even outsource it at this point.

# Types of Products

Choose what works best for your goals:

* Desktop based, downloadable
* Mobile apps
* SaaS
* Consulting Services
* Productized Services
* Educational/Training Products
* Ebooks or paper books
* Video courses or tutorials
* Onboarding services or setup costs

# Idea Generation, Filtering, Validation, Execution

Generation:

* interact with the world around you to learn about their problems
* have a brainstorming session: focus on quantity, not quality
* usually one idea will lead to another two or three, think outside the box
* remember to concentrate on solving people's existing problems
* consider copying an existing product
* after you choose a market, listen to prospective customers and listen to their complaints
* scratch your own itch

Choose a market to serve:

* do you like these people?
* will you enjoy solving problems for this group?
* do you want to be an expert in this field?

Filtering:

* it's important to niche down and focus!
* consider pros/cons for each idea, do you have expertise/network? Is it difficult to explain?
* avoid two-sided markets
* avoid difficult customer groups that are known to avoid new technology
* avoid indirect revenue streams (you want to charge the customer directly)
* avoid network effects requirement (eg. social networking sites)
* avoid products with no revenue model

Validation:

* create an MVP (landing page with email submission)
* build mockups, design pages so it looks like "screenshots", create a video and post to site,
  conduct customer interviews for feedback, try to get pre-sales
* the underlying question is: will they pay you for it?

Answer these questions for validation:

* what traits define the target customer?
* are these people willing to pay for it?
* can I get in front of these people?
* what are the best traffic channels?
* what marketing copy will resonate with my target customers?
* can I reach critical mass of customers to be worth my time?
* should this product be built?

Defining your target customers:

* where do they hang out online?
* what kind of websites do they visit?
* what's their job title?
* what kind of businesses do they work in?
* do they have purchasing authority?
* how much is their time worth?
* what are three things they spend most of their days on?

Execution:

* try to reduce/cut work to the bare essentials
* include time for non product development activities, such as marketing
* outsource whatever you can
* make working on your product a habit you do every day

# Marketing Your First Product

Build a marketing plan which requires: goal, milestones, positioning statement, value proposition,
motivations, objections, ideal customers, competition, tactics.

The goal states your objective and why you're trying to achieve it. It should be SMART.

Milestones are stepping stones towards your long term goal.

A positioning statement is a single sentence that describes your product:

    [idea] [what it does] for [target customers] who is/are [criteria 1] and [criteria 2].

The value proposition describes why your product is useful.

Motivations for your customer should be listed out, why should your customer use this solution?

Common objections should also be listed out so you can solve them in your marketing copy.

Tactics it the bulk of your marketing plan. What do you need to do to market your product?

* auto-responder emails and email courses
* giveaways
* submitting app to directories
* press releases
* contacting bloggers
* posting in forums
* website design
* in-person events
* conference sponsorships
* SEO
* paid acquisition
* partnerships and integrations
* social media
* sales funnel optimization
* cold calling
* direct emails
* etc...
