# Mastery

By Robert Greene, a how to guide on mastering your craft.

# Follow Masters Before You

Mastery isn't innate. Charles Darwin's younger cousin, Francis Galton had a much higher IQ. But
Darwin is who we hear about today. To master a skill or field, simply follow the steps of every
master that came before you.

The steps to mastery:

1. Discover your field
2. Engage in an apprenticeship
3. Develop a creative/open mind
4. Achieve mastery

# Inner Calling

Leonardo Da Vinci became fascinated with art after he stole his father's paper to sketch animals
in the forest.

Be careful not to just follow the crowd. You have to recognize your own fascination with a field
to figure out your inner calling.

# Learn As Much As Possible

Your initial goal shouldn't be immediate success or most money/prestige. Instead, aim for a
job/opportunity where you can learn as much as possible about your chosen field.

Freddie Roach took an unpaid job at a boxing center to develop his skills. He learned as much as
possible and eventually earned much more money than if he took an initial paying position. Darwin
rejected medical school to become an unpaid naturalist. This led him to his theory of evolution.

You'll usually learn as much as possible in an apprenticeship, so seek one out.

# Mentorship

Learning is difficult. Make it easier by finding a mentor. A mentor will:

1. guide you
2. help you use your time effectively
3. be more invested in you because they see a younger version of him/herself
4. be admired by you, so you'll pay much closer attention

Don't forget your ultimate goal should be to outmatch your mentor.

# Think Innovatively, Challenge Rules, Broaden Mind

Children are freethinkers and rule breakers. You need open-mindness and absence of fear. This
audacity lets you break rules and expectations.

For example, Mozart began composing his own music by fusing styles he already learned from his own
mentors. He added some of his own elements. He created new music with originality.

Don't think too narrowly. Always ask if there's a better way to solve particular problems -- even
though you've been training a specific way. Next, train yourself to make new connections.

# Practice Until Automatic, Focus on Bigger Picture

Mastery means responding automatically in high pressure situations and also seeing the big picture.
It means viewing the high strategic level but also performing perfectly at a low tactical level.
And it means connecting the two automatically, through plenty of practice.
