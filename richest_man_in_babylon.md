# The Richest Man in Babylon

By George S. Clason, a set of rules that a fictional man in ancient Babylon followed to build
wealth.

Once upon a time in ancient Babylon, there was a very rich man named Arkad. He built his wealth by...

# Saving and Invest Wisely

Don't just hoard money, but use it wisely.

Money in the mattress won't increase in value. Money in the bank probably won't beat inflation.
Invest it in something that generates more wealth: stocks, bonds, funding start ups.

Invest wisely in people who know how to use it. Invest in a lumberjack if he's using it for a
wood business, not if he's starting a diamond business. Give money to a hedge fund for them to
invest.

# Admitting How Little He Knew

You don't know much. Don't assume otherwise.

People learned the basics of investing and charged ahead with subprime mortgages causing the
crash of 2008. Don't do this.

Realize that your expertise is in whatever your specialization is. Don't invest in areas where you
believe you're an expert in, but you've only basic knowledge.

# Accumulating Wealth Slowly via Trial and Error

Building wealth takes time. It takes risk. There will be failed experiments that you'll learn from.
You will fail, so don't invest money you cant afford to lose.

# Making Long Term Investments

Making money means working for money. It's short term.

Attaining wealth means having money work for you. It's long term.

Go ahead and work hard at your career to make more money. But save that money, make investments,
and build wealth.

# Investing with Interest

Imagine starting a factory. You need raw materials and resources and you'll have to pay for it.
You'll also need capital or money to build the factory. So capital is a resource like any other.
Which means you'll have to pay for it -- this is done via interest.

Interest is the best way to build wealth because it increases over time. Compound interest makes
it even better.

# Working to Spot Opportunities and Seizing Them

Make yourself luckier by constantly looking out for opportunities to increase your wealth.

Think of an entrepreneur who is interested in consumer technology, so she reads trend reports every
day. When she reads about 3D television trends and knows an inventor that can produce 3D televisions
for half the price, she can seize the opportunity by providing capital or resources. All of that
work reading trend reports will pay off.

# Not Taking on Debt

Debt is the opposite of interest and will deplete your wealth. Just don't do it.
