# Convict Conditioning

By Paul "Coach" Wade, a bodyweight fitness book that introduces six exercises to work out the entire
body. These notes are best accompanied with photos of each exercise.

# Preliminaries

The benefits of bodyweight training:

1. requires little equipment
2. develops useful/functional abilities
3. maximizes strength
4. protects joints and makes them stronger
5. develops physique

There are six core movements listed below. Each movement has ten steps: the progression. Step 1 is
what you start with, Step 10 is what you aspire to. It gets slightly harder with each step.

The ultimate goal is to reach all six final steps. The final step for each movement are:

1. one-arm push-up
2. one-leg squat
3. one-arm pull-up
4. hanging leg raise
5. stand-to-stand bridge
6. one-arm handstand push-up

For warm ups, Wade recommends doing the previous two steps and their recommended sets/reps. So
if you're at One-arm Push-ups, do 1/2 One-Arm Push-ups and Lever Push-ups for 2x20 each as a warm
up.

# The Big Six

## Push-up

Works pectorals, anterior deltoid, and triceps.

Use your palms. Avoid bizarre angles by keeping torso, hips, and legs in alignment. Keep legs
together. Lower yourself down until your chest and floor have about a baseball's width of space.
Try not to go too fast because you'll be using momentum instead of your muscles.

Progression:

1. Wall Push-ups -> 3x50
2. Incline Push-ups -> 3x40
3. Kneeling Push-ups -> 3x30
4. Half Push-ups -> 2x25
5. Full Push-ups -> 2x20
6. Close Push-ups -> 2x20
7. Uneven Push-ups -> 2x20
8. 1/2 One-Arm Push-ups -> 2x20
9. Lever Push-ups -> 2x20
10. One-arm Push-ups -> 1x100

## Squat

Works quadriceps, gluteal muscles, hamstrings, inner thighs, hips, calves, and feet.

A full range means calves press against hamstrings and you can't push down further. Straighten
legs for next squat. Bend forwards, but not too far when descending. Think of sitting into an
invisible chair. As with all motions, pause for a second at the bottom.

Progression:

1. Shoulderstand Squats -> 3x50
2. Jackknife Squats -> 3x40
3. Supported Squats -> 3x30
4. Half Squats -> 2x50
5. Full Squats -> 2x30
6. Close Squats -> 2x20
7. Uneven Squats -> 2x20
8. 1/2 One-Leg Squats -> 2x20
9. Assisted One-Leg Squats -> 2x20
10. One-Leg Squats -> 2x50

## Pull-up

Works latissimus dorsi (wings) teres, rhomboid and trapezius, biceps, forearms, and hands.

The ideal range is from your arms being almost straight to your chin reaching the bar. No need to
extend past this point. Keep your shoulders right.

Progression:

1. Vertical Pulls -> 3x40
2. Horizontal Pulls -> 3x30
3. Jackknife Pulls -> 3x20
4. Half Pull-ups -> 2x15
5. Full Pull-ups -> 2x10
6. Close Pull-ups -> 2x10
7. Uneven Pull-ups -> 2x9
8. 1/2 One-Arm Pull-ups -> 2x8
9. Assisted One-Arm Pull-ups -> 2x7
10. One-Arm Pull-ups -> 2x6

## Leg Raise

Works abdomens, obliques, outer/inner rib muscles, diaphragm, grip, quadriceps, and frontal hip.

Slowly raise your straight leg, knees locked, until they're parallel to the floor. Pause for a
second until you start lowering them back.

1. Knee Tucks -> 3x40
2. Flat Knee Raises -> 3x35
3. Flat Bent Leg Raises -> 3x30
4. Flat Frog Raises -> 3x25
5. Flag Straight Leg Raises -> 2x15
6. Hanging Knee Raises -> 2x15
7. Hanging Bent Leg Raises -> 2x15
8. Hanging Frog Raises -> 2x15
9. Partial Straight Leg Raises -> 2x15
10. Straight Leg Raises -> 2x30

## Bridge

Works all spine muscles, lower back, rear hips, and leg biceps.

Bridging eliminates most back problems that you'll encounter while aging. The final step involves
standing straight, bending over backwards into a bridge, and smoothly reversing to stand up again.

1. Short Bridges -> 3x50
2. Straight Bridges -> 3x40
3. Angled Bridges -> 3x30
4. Head Bridges -> 2x25
5. Half Bridges -> 2x20
6. Full Bridges -> 2x15
7. Wall Walking Bridges (Down) -> 2x10
8. Wall Walking Bridges (Up) -> 2x8
9. Closing Bridges -> 2x6
10. Stand-to-Stand Bridges -> 2x30

## Handstand Push-up

Works triceps, shoulder muscles, trapezius muscles, hands, fingers, and forearms.

This exercise involves balance and strength. It can be done with or without a wall, without means
you'll use more focus on balance. The first steps trains your body for balance, the later steps
kicks up the strength required.

1. Wall Headstands -> 2 mins
2. Crow Stands -> 1 min
3. Wall Handstands -> 2 mins
4. Half Handstand Push-ups -> 2x20
5. Handstand Push-ups -> 2x15
6. Close Handstand Push-ups -> 2x12
7. Uneven Handstand Push-ups -> 2x10
8. 1/2 One-Arm Handstand Push-ups -> 2x8
9. Lever Handstand Push-ups -> 2x6
10. One-Arm Handstand Push-ups -> 2x5
